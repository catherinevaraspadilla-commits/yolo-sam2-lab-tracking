# Tracking Techniques Analysis — BoT-SORT & ByteTrack

Analysis of the Ultralytics tracker YAML configurations and their impact
on lab rat tracking with occlusions, wall interactions, and close contact.

All information sourced from the installed `ultralytics==8.4.14` package.

## 1. Tracker Overview

Our pipeline uses `model.track(persist=True, tracker="botsort.yaml")` which
delegates to the Ultralytics BoT-SORT implementation. BoT-SORT extends
ByteTrack with Global Motion Compensation (GMC) and optional ReID.

Both trackers share the same two-stage association algorithm from ByteTrack.
BoT-SORT adds camera motion handling and appearance features on top.

## 2. Parameter Analysis

### 2.1 `track_buffer` — Lost Track Lifetime

| | |
|---|---|
| **Default** | `30` |
| **Type** | int (frames) |
| **Classification** | **Pipeline Improvement** (already parametrizable) |

**What it does:** Number of frames a lost track survives before permanent deletion.
When YOLO misses a detection (e.g., rat partially behind the other), the track
enters "Lost" state and its Kalman filter continues predicting position. If matched
again within `track_buffer` frames, the track resumes with the same ID.

**Important detail:** The actual frame count is `int(frame_rate / 30.0 * track_buffer)`.
Ultralytics hardcodes `frame_rate=30`, so `track_buffer: 30` always = 30 frames
regardless of actual video FPS.

**Track lifecycle:**
```
New → Tracked → [detection lost] → Lost → [matched again] → Tracked
                                        → [buffer exceeded] → Removed (permanent)
```

**Tradeoffs for lab rats:**

| Value | Behavior | When to use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 15-20 | Short memory, quick ID release | Fast-moving animals, no prolonged occlusions |
| 30 (default) | ~1 second at 25fps | General purpose, brief wall interactions |
| 60-90 | 2-3 seconds | Rats that hide behind each other frequently |
| 120+ | 4+ seconds | Extended grooming/huddling where one rat is hidden |

**Risk of high values:** If a track is lost and the rat reappears far away, the
old track may incorrectly match to a different rat. The Kalman prediction
diverges from reality after many frames, but the Hungarian algorithm may
still find a "least bad" match.

**Recommendation for lab rats:** `track_buffer: 60` — rats in 640x480 lab videos
rarely disappear for more than 2 seconds, and this gives enough buffer for
brief wall occlusions without excessive ID drift risk.

### 2.2 Thresholds — Two-Stage Matching

#### How two-stage matching works

```
All YOLO detections
  │
  ├── conf >= track_high_thresh (0.25)
  │     → FIRST PASS: match against ALL tracks (active + lost)
  │       Uses: IoU distance + fuse_score + ReID (if enabled)
  │       Hungarian threshold: match_thresh (0.8)
  │       Unmatched detections with conf >= new_track_thresh → create new track
  │
  ├── track_low_thresh (0.1) < conf < track_high_thresh (0.25)
  │     → SECOND PASS: match against REMAINING active tracks only
  │       Uses: raw IoU distance only (no fuse_score, no ReID)
  │       Hungarian threshold: hardcoded 0.5 (stricter, NOT configurable)
  │
  └── conf <= track_low_thresh (0.1)
        → DISCARDED entirely
```

#### `track_high_thresh` (default: 0.25)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Classification** | **Pipeline Improvement** (already parametrizable) |

Detections with confidence >= this enter the primary association pass with the
full cost matrix. Aligns with our `detection.confidence: 0.25`.

**Recommendation:** Keep at `0.25` to stay synchronized with the pipeline's
confidence threshold.

#### `track_low_thresh` (default: 0.1)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Classification** | **Pipeline Improvement** (already parametrizable) |

Absolute floor — detections below this are never used. Detections between
`low` and `high` thresholds enter the second pass (IoU-only, stricter).

**Why this matters for rats:** When a rat is partially occluded by the wall or
the other rat, YOLO confidence drops (e.g., from 0.6 to 0.15). The second stage
ensures these low-confidence detections can still match existing active tracks.

**Recommendation:** Keep at `0.1`.

#### `new_track_thresh` (default: 0.25)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Classification** | **Pipeline Improvement** (already parametrizable) |

After both passes, unmatched first-pass detections with confidence >= this create
new tracks. Since default equals `track_high_thresh`, every unmatched high-conf
detection creates a track. Setting higher (e.g., 0.3) creates a gap where
medium-confidence unmatched detections don't spawn spurious tracks.

**Recommendation:** `new_track_thresh: 0.3` — reduces false track creation from
transient noise while still picking up new rats quickly.

---

### 2.3 `match_thresh` — Association Cost Threshold

| | |
|---|---|
| **Default** | `0.8` |
| **Classification** | **Pipeline Improvement** (already parametrizable) |

Maximum cost for Hungarian assignment in the first pass. Cost = IoU distance
(1 - IoU), optionally fused with confidence.

- `0.8` → allows matches with IoU as low as 0.2 (very permissive)
- `0.5` → requires IoU >= 0.5 (stricter)

**Note:** The second pass and unconfirmed track association use hardcoded
thresholds (0.5 and 0.7 respectively) — NOT configurable via YAML.

**Recommendation:** Keep at `0.8`. Frame-to-frame IoU for lab rats is usually
high (>0.5) but can drop during fast movement or near walls. The permissive
threshold lets the Kalman filter bridge these gaps.

---

### 2.4 `fuse_score` — Confidence-IoU Fusion

| | |
|---|---|
| **Default** | `True` |
| **Classification** | **Pipeline Improvement** (already parametrizable) |

Multiplies IoU similarity by detection confidence: `fused_cost = 1 - (IoU * confidence)`.

**Effect:**

| Detection conf | IoU | Cost without fuse | Cost with fuse |
|---------------|-----|-------------------|----------------|
| 0.9 | 0.6 | 0.40 | 0.46 |
| 0.3 | 0.6 | 0.40 | 0.82 |

Biases matching toward high-confidence detections. Prevents low-confidence noise
from stealing tracks from legitimate detections.

**Recommendation:** Keep `True`.

---

### 2.5 `gmc_method` — Global Motion Compensation (BoT-SORT only)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Default** | `sparseOptFlow` |
| **Classification** | **Pipeline Improvement** (already parametrizable) |

Estimates camera motion between frames and compensates Kalman filter predictions.

| Method | Description | Use case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `sparseOptFlow` | Lucas-Kanade optical flow | Moving/shaking cameras |
| `orb` | ORB feature matching | Moving cameras, moderate speed |
| `sift` | SIFT feature matching | Moving cameras, best accuracy |
| `ecc` | Enhanced Correlation Coefficient | Small camera vibrations |
| `none` | Disabled (identity transform) | **Static cameras** |

**For lab rat tracking:** Our cameras are static (fixed overhead mount). Camera
motion compensation adds ~5-10% compute with no benefit.

**Recommendation:** `gmc_method: none`.

---

### 2.6 `with_reid` — Re-Identification (BoT-SORT only)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Default** | `False` |
| **Classification** | **Technique Analyzed** (available but requires evaluation) |

Enables appearance-based feature extraction for track matching. When enabled,
the final cost is the element-wise minimum of IoU cost and appearance cost:

```
final_cost = min(IoU_cost, appearance_cost)
```

If either IoU OR appearance produces a good match, the pair is associated.
Helps recover tracks after occlusion when IoU is poor but appearance is
recognizable.

**Two modes:**
- `model: auto` — uses YOLO's own intermediate features as embeddings.
  Zero extra model overhead (hooks into the Detect layer input).
- `model: yolov8n-cls.pt` — separate classification model as encoder.
  Crops each detection, runs through encoder. Adds significant latency.

**Related parameters (only active when `with_reid: True`):**
- `proximity_thresh: 0.5` — spatial gate: only consider ReID for pairs with
  IoU >= 0.5. Prevents matching across the frame.
- `appearance_thresh: 0.8` — minimum embedding similarity. Rejects pairs
  with low appearance match.

**Expected impact for visually similar lab rats:**

| Scenario | Expected benefit |
|----------|-----------------|
| Different colored rats | High — ReID can distinguish by appearance |
| Same color, different size | Medium — subtle size features may help |
| Identical appearance (our case) | **Low** — features may not discriminate |
| After prolonged occlusion | Medium — even partial appearance matching helps |

**Risk:** For visually identical rats, ReID might cause MORE swaps by confidently
matching the wrong rat based on similar appearance.

**Recommendation:** Start with `with_reid: False` (current). If ID switches
persist during prolonged occlusions, test `with_reid: True, model: auto` as
it adds minimal overhead. Expect limited benefit for visually identical rats.

## 4. Recommended BoT-SORT Config for Lab Rat Tracking

Save as `configs/trackers/lab_rats_botsort.yaml`:

```yaml
# BoT-SORT config optimized for lab rat tracking
# Static overhead camera, 2 visually similar rats, 25fps, 640x480

tracker_type: botsort

# --- Two-stage association ---
track_high_thresh: 0.25    # First pass: confident detections
track_low_thresh: 0.1      # Second pass floor: recover partial occlusions
new_track_thresh: 0.3      # Slightly above high_thresh to reduce false new tracks

# --- Track persistence ---
track_buffer: 60           # ~2 seconds at 25fps. Survives brief wall occlusions
                           # without excessive ID drift risk.

# --- Association ---
match_thresh: 0.8          # Permissive IoU matching (Kalman bridges gaps)
fuse_score: True           # Bias toward high-confidence detections

# --- Camera motion ---
gmc_method: none           # Static camera — no compensation needed.
                           # Saves ~5-10% compute per frame.

# --- ReID (disabled by default) ---
# Enable with_reid if ID switches persist during prolonged rat-on-rat occlusion.
# Expect limited benefit for visually identical rats.
proximity_thresh: 0.5      # Spatial gate for ReID
appearance_thresh: 0.8     # Appearance similarity gate
with_reid: False           # Set True to test ReID
model: auto                # Uses YOLO features (no extra model)
```

**Usage:**

```yaml
# In your pipeline config (local_quick.yaml or hpc_full.yaml):
tracking:
  tracker_config: configs/trackers/lab_rats_botsort.yaml
```

```bash
# Or via CLI override:
python -m src.pipelines.sam2_yolo.run --config configs/local_quick.yaml \
    tracking.tracker_config=configs/trackers/lab_rats_botsort.yaml
```

## 5. BoT-SORT vs ByteTrack

ByteTrack is BoT-SORT without GMC and ReID. Shares all 7 base parameters.

| Feature | BoT-SORT | ByteTrack |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Two-stage matching | Yes | Yes |
| Kalman filter | XYWH (width+height independent) | XYAH (aspect ratio coupled) |
| Global Motion Compensation | Yes (`gmc_method`) | No |
| ReID appearance features | Yes (`with_reid`) | No |
| Compute overhead | Higher (GMC + optional ReID) | Lower |

With our recommended config (`gmc_method: none`, `with_reid: False`), BoT-SORT
is nearly identical to ByteTrack. The remaining difference is Kalman filter
parameterization — BoT-SORT's independent width/height (XYWH) is slightly
better for rats whose aspect ratio changes (stretching, curling up).

**Recommendation:** Stay with BoT-SORT + the optimized config.
