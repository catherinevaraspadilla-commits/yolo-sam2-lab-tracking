# BoT-SORT config optimized for lab rat tracking
# Static overhead camera, 2 visually similar rats, 25fps, 640x480
#
# Key changes from ultralytics defaults:
#   new_track_thresh: 0.25 → 0.3  (reduce false new tracks during occlusion)
#   track_buffer: 30 → 60         (survive 2s occlusion instead of 1s)
#   gmc_method: sparseOptFlow → none (static camera, save compute)
#
# See docs/tracking-techniques-analysis.md for full parameter analysis.

tracker_type: botsort

# --- Two-stage association ---
track_high_thresh: 0.25    # First pass: confident detections
track_low_thresh: 0.1      # Second pass floor: recover partial occlusions
new_track_thresh: 0.3      # Above high_thresh to reduce false new tracks

# --- Track persistence ---
track_buffer: 60           # ~2 seconds at 25fps. Survives brief occlusions
                           # without excessive ID drift risk.

# --- Association ---
match_thresh: 0.8          # Permissive IoU matching (Kalman bridges gaps)
fuse_score: true           # Bias toward high-confidence detections

# --- Camera motion ---
gmc_method: none           # Static camera — no compensation needed.
