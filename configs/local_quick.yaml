# --- Detection (YOLO) ---
detection:
  # Minimum confidence score to keep a detection.
  # Range: [0.0, 1.0]. Lower = more detections (more noise).
  # Typical values: 0.25 (permissive) to 0.5 (strict).
  confidence: 0.25

  # Maximum number of animals expected in the scene.
  # Used to cap mask filtering — keeps at most this many instances.
  max_animals: 2

  # Keypoint names for pose models (must match training annotation order).
  # The yolov8lrata.pt model has 7 keypoints per detection.
  # Set to null to use defaults from infer_yolo.py.
  keypoint_names:
    - tail_tip
    - tail_base
    - tail_start

  # Set to "ratas" to filter out non-rat detections.

  # 0 = no padding, 32-64 = recommended for border issues.
  yolo_border_padding_px: 0

  # Edge margin: reject detections whose centroid is within N pixels of frame border.
  # Helps suppress flickering partial detections at walls.
  # 0 = disabled. 10-15 = recommended for lab videos.
  edge_margin: 0

  # Custom NMS IoU threshold. null = use YOLO default (~0.7).
  # Lower values (0.3-0.5) suppress merged boxes when animals touch.

# --- Segmentation (SAM2) ---
segmentation:
  # Threshold applied to raw SAM2 mask logits.
  # Range: [-inf, +inf], typically 0.0. Higher = stricter mask boundary.

  # Range: [0.0, 1.0]. Masks with IoU above this are considered duplicates.

# --- Closeness analysis (for extract_frames) ---
closeness:
  # Normalized distance threshold for "close" classification.
  # Distance between detection centroids is normalized by the frame diagonal.
  # Range: [0.0, 1.0]. Lower = stricter (must be closer).
  # 0.15 means centroids within 15% of the frame diagonal.
  distance_threshold_norm: 0.15

  # IoU threshold between bounding boxes for "close" classification.
  # Range: [0.0, 1.0]. Any pair above this triggers "close".

encounters:
  # Maximum gap (seconds) between close frames to merge into one encounter.

# --- Tracking ---

  # "bytetrack.yaml" (simpler, faster). Can also be a path to custom YAML.
  tracker_config: botsort.yaml

  # Maximum pixel distance for centroid-based cost normalization.

  # 150px typical for 640x480. Scale up for higher resolutions.
  max_centroid_distance: 150.0

  # Consecutive frames a slot survives without a match before release.
  # Prevents color swap when YOLO briefly misses a rat (e.g., at borders).
  max_missing_frames: 5

  # Hungarian assignment cost weights (must sum to ~1.0).
  # w_dist: centroid distance (normalized by max_centroid_distance)

# --- Video output ---

  # Video codec for overlay output.
  #   "XVID" -> .avi, universal playback (recommended)
  #   "avc1" -> .mp4 H.264, needs OpenH264 library installed
  #   "mp4v" -> .mp4 MPEG-4 Part 2, may not play on Windows
